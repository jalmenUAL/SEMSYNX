Ben Carson is choosing Detroit for a little prayer and politicking today â€” with a schedule that includes a prayer breakfast with city pastors, an assembly at the Detroit high school that bears his name and the official launch of his presidential campaign. Carson told a Florida TV station Sunday night that he's definitely in the race. And from Detroit, he had been scheduled to travel to Iowa, for three days of events in the pivotal state where the first presidential caucus of the 2016 election cycle will be held Feb. 1. But he switched up his plans early Monday and said he'll go to Dallas to be with his critically ill mother Sonya Carson. I'm willing to be part of the equation and, therefore, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America, Carson told WPEC-TV, the CBS affiliate in West Palm Beach, Fla. in an exclusive interview. At the Charles Wright Museum of African American History, Carson told reporters that he's anxious to hear what other GOP candidates have to say.
